# ride-my-way-carpooling-app
Ride-My-Way is a carpool app. 
Designed to create flexibility in the user-travel experience. 
Users can offer to share vacant seats in their car while enroute their destination.
This Project was created with HTML , CSS, and Vanilla Javascript thus far.

So far, no backend functionalities have been added, but the front end works perfectly.
